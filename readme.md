# README

This repo contains collections for use with Postman and the IDX Broker API.

The collections vary in size and tests. Collections are created for specific versions of the API.

## Requirements

To pass all tests:
* Environment variable url
* Environment variables for request headers
* A valid IDX Broker Client API key is required.
* A valid IDX Broker Partner API key is required.
* An account with a featured listing is required

Search Query will likely fail as this is turned off for all MLSs.

## Install

Use Run in postman button in the readme of the collection or download a collection then import.

Download an environment and import to your postman.

If you don't have postman you might want to get it because it's awesome.
