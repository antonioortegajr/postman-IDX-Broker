# Postman Tests

Postman can test each API call. This is done via JavaScript.

Examples are in this repo. These tests run every single API call or when a collection is ran.

examples from postman site: https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/test_examples

Variables can be set or unset and used in multiple calls once initially set.
