# Environments

Postman environments allow you set variables to be used with a collection.

Set urls, header values, and more. There are two environments in this repo.

One is for Live and has the {{url}} set to api.idxbroker. this allows the tester
to switch between environments easily.

## Use

Import an environment to your postman and use with a collection expecting the set variables.
