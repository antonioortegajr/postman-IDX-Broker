# Environments

Postman environments allow you set variables to be used with a collection.

Live has the {{url}} set to api.idxbroker. This allows the tester
to switch between environments easily.

## Use

Import an environment to your postman and use with a collection expecting the set variables.

You can download this repo and import from local or create a json file on local and copy this environment json to it.

Add you IDX API keys to the environment.
