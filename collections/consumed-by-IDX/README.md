# Collection of endpoints consumed by IDX Broker

This collection is API endpoints used by the IDX Broker WordPress plugin and the IDX Broker facebook application.

This collection relies on variables set in an environment in Postman. For example the API key is set to {{apikey}} for my testing environment but can be changed to suit your environment settings in postman. https://www.getpostman.com/docs/environments

This collection also tests for status codes and valid json. There is no XML test and the json test will fail if you request xml.
